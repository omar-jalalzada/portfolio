          Working for Moovweb has been an experience of a lifetime. I started from a basic entry position and 34 months later I was the creative director for the company.
          %br
          Through this journey I gained a termendous amount of knowledge about the industry and business. Below are a sample of projects I have been involved in as designer, developer and director:

              As the Creative Director I wanted to create a branding guideline that would align all the creative efforts within the company. We were growing rapidly and the amount of content being generated were increasing significantly,

              introduced consistency and efficiency for all those efforts.

              The public facing website was one of the most challenging tasks I had to deal with. Our ever evolving messaging, product direction and agility in content created interesting challenges that had to be dealt with. 
            %p 
              I designed and developed the site within a month and a half that resulted in higher engagment rates, longer visits and lower bounce rate. The development stack consist of Ruby on Rails deployed on Heroku and served through the Moovweb Platform. I utilized our own platform to create a single code base for both Mobile and Desktop, which was the first ever use case for showcasing "subdomain agnostic" abilities of the product.
