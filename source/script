About Me:
I'm Omar Jalalzada, a San Francisco based designer. Born in Kabul, Afghanistan I started my journey in life far from where I currently stand, it gave me perspective and the ability to look at life holistically. 
 
In my opinion good design doesn't just stop at perfecting pixels; understanding business goals, target markets and a product's vision are key factors that should drive design decisions. 
I'm passionate about impacting people lives with design. So, I work with brands to elevate the human attributes of their product and make it more relatable to their consumers.

// On my off days I play soccer, attend music shows, watch live comedy or grab brews with friends at a local bar.


Moovweb
Working for Moovweb has been an experience of a lifetime. I started from a basic entry position and 34 months later I was the creative director for the company. Through this journey I gained a termendous amount of knowledge about the industry and business. Below are a few samples of the projects I have been involved in as a designer, developer and director:



Moovweb - Branding Guideline
As the Creative Director I wanted to create a branding guideline that would align all the creative efforts within the company. We were growing rapidly and the amount of content being genereated were increasing significantly, this document introduced consistency and efficiency for all those efforts. Here is the PDF version of what Me and one of my designers Moly Yim came up with.



Moovweb - Corporate Site
The public facing website was one of the most challenging tasks I had to deal with. Our ever evolving messaging, product direction and agility in content created interesting challenges that had to be dealt with. 
I designed and developed the site within a month and a half that resulted in higher engagment rates, longer visits and drops in bounce rate. The development stack consist of Ruby on Rails deployed on Heroku and served through the Moovweb Platform. I utilized our own platform to create a single code base for both Mobile and Desktop, which was the first ever user case of @#$%^&* in the history of our product.



Moovweb - Blog
We wanted to be thought leaders within our space and have means of communicating our opinions. I created a Wordpress blog that can be utilized by multiple stake holders and let them easily generate content and publish. We managed to drive a hefty amount of traffic to our other web assets through this channel.
I worked on this project with one of my designer Moly Yim and this was our first attempt on collaborating with Sketch 2.0 (didn't worked out quite well :)



Moovweb - Social
We focused on social media to express our opinion and engage potential customers and in order to be effective in doing so we needed to have a professional consistent look and feel for all our medium.



Moovweb - Harlem Shake the Web
When Harlem Shake videos were found under every rock you picked up, we wanted to ride the wave and create something slightly cooler.
Ishan Anand, Hari Ananth and I got together to build a Bookmarklet that will make any website on the web do the shake.
We launched it as a Valentine Gift to web through our blog and drove abou 26k of traffic on the same day with additional 16k in the following day.
It was featured on Techcrunch, Hufftingtpost, HackerNews, Reddit and others.

We didn't just create a bookmarklet, we created a revolution.
A revolution of pointless extentions. I will die happy.
Youtube took our idea and did an easter egg. A few others tried their own:

Moovweb - White Paper
Moovweb's platform integerates nicely with Responsive Design's best practices. In order to educate potential customers we created a printable document that can also be sent via PDF. This empowered our Sales staff with the right tool in regards to this conversation.
Credits to Moly Yim for all his work on this project and here is the PDF.
